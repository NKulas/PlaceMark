# PlaceMark
Xamarin Forms app for marking waypoints

## Description
The app allows a user to create waypoints. The latitude and longitude can be entered manually or taken from the user's current location. The waypoints are saved and can be viewed on a map at any time.

## Origin
This was my final project for the class Intro to Mobile Development. The final was a self-directed project to make an app. Some parts of the code a adapted from class demos. The ViewModel class specifically was created by my instructor. However, the design of the app and a good majority of the code are my own work.
